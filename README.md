# Go Practice

This repository is my personal playground for learning **Go**.  
Here I experiment with different Go concepts, small projects, and exercises.

## About

- All main projects and experiments are organized in separate **branches**.  
- `main` branch contains only this README.  
- You can explore other branches to see the code I wrote and practice with.

## What you will find
- **Banking System**: A simple banking system with basic functionalities like deposit, withdraw, and check balance.

## Usage

```bash
go run . -mode=server -port=8080
```
or
```bash
go run . -mode=cli
```
