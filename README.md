# Go Practice

This repository is my personal playground for learning **Go**.  
Here I experiment with different Go concepts, small projects, and exercises.

## About

- All main projects and experiments are organized in separate **branches**.  
- `main` branch contains only this README.  
- You can explore other branches to see the code I wrote and practice with.

## What you will find

- CLI utilities  
- Simple web servers  
- Experiments with pointers, memory, and goroutines  
- Small games and exercises  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teasec4/go_practice.git
